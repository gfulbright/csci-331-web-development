        <p>Phineas and the Ferb-Tones is a 2000's pop band with members Phineas Flynn, Ferb Fletcher, Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, the Fireside Girls, and feature guest appearance from Candace Flynn.</p>
        <p>The group's motivation was to write a catchy tune with meaningless lyrics to become a successful pop song.</p>
        <p>They followed the popstar checklist to become a one-hit wonder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a hit record</li>
            <li>Melt down in a diva tantrum</li>
            <li>Have your music reduced to elevator music</li>
            <li>Become popular once again in a reunion tour</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Read about them on <a href="https://phineasandferb.fandom.com/wiki/Phineas_and_the_Ferb-Tones">this website</a> and watch their hit song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0PpsQ3wcUc">on YouTube.</a></p>
